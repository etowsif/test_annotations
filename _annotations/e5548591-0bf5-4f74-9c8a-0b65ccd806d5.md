F. M. Mann is the author of the above hymn. He was said to have had a very strong voice, a good singer and was a music teacher. He was a Georgian, living near Milledgeville, where he died several years ago, diseased in body and mind. He was a member of the Methodist church, and highly respected by all who knew him. He was also a member of the Southern Musical Convention and the Chattahoochee Musical Convention. He has seventeen tunes credited to him in the " Sacred Harp." </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">J. L. White may have been James&rsquo;s connection. Mann was closely connected to J. L. White&rsquo;s father, the Sacred Harp compiler B. F. White and his family: two siblings of his married White&rsquo;s children. Mann lived in the West Georgia environs where the White family was also active. He suffered from dementia late in life and moved to the State Facility in Milledgeville where he died in 1891.</span></span></p>
