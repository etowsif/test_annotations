Durham: </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffff00; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A composer in W. Walker&rsquo;s circle, Matilda T. Durham (1815&ndash;1901) </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">contributed this and four other songs to editions of his Southern Harmony and Southern and Western Pocket Harmonist between 1835 and 1846. Born in Spartanburg County, Durham married Hoy in 1843 and moved to Cobb County, Georgia, where she is buried. In addition to composing, Durham was a music teacher and was a locally celebrated author of &ldquo;a number of articles for religious papers.&rdquo; (cited in Kimberling p. 9). </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffff00; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Believed to be an original composition, THE PROMISED LAND is celebrated as one of the earliest hymn tunes composed by an American woman. Yet James wasn&rsquo;t able to learn anything about Durham and downgraded the attribution to &ldquo;Arr.&rdquo; asserting without evidence in OSH that &ldquo;the melody of this tune, and its main features, can be traced back for over one hundred years.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> James was also dismissive of Durham&rsquo;s role, stating &ldquo;We have been unable to find out anything about her, and whether or not she arranged the tune for the "Sacred Harp," and made changes in it.&rdquo; </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffff00; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">James&rsquo;s skepticism may be gendered, and may also have to do with a general tendency of his to undervalue attributions to figures who he couldn&rsquo;t identify in the historical record or through sources in his social network.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> [Sources are Kimberling&rsquo;s unpublished paper cited below and his Canterbury article.]</span></p>
