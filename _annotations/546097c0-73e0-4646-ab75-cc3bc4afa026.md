John Leland was born in 1754 and died in 1844. He was a Baptist preacher. In 1801 he took a preaching tour from his home in Massachusetts to Washington with his Cheshire cheese, and made his name national on account of that trip. He wrote his own hymns. He composed the hymn, "The Day is Passed and Gone, The Evening Shades Appear." The farmers of Cheshire, for whom he was pastor, conceived the idea of sending the biggest cheese in America to President Jefferson. Mr. Leland offered to go to Washington with an ox team with it, and preach all along the way, which he did. The cheese weighed 1,450 pounds. He died with bright hopes of rest in the glory world.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span></p>
