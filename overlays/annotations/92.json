Leland&rsquo;s journey to Washington celebrated Jefferson&rsquo;s election with an outsize political message of its own. The &ldquo;mammoth cheese,&rdquo; made solely from the milk of cows owned by non-slaveholders (the milk of &ldquo;Federal[ist] cows&rdquo; was also excluded), was Leland&rsquo;s expression of support for Jefferson&rsquo;s advocacy of the separation of church and state and also monument to his own abolitionist leanings. When it arrived in Washington, the great cheese was enthusiastically welcomed by the president and prominently displayed at the White House for more than two years. Subsequent cheese makers followed in Leland&rsquo;s footsteps. Thomas Meacham of Sandy Creek, New York, delivered a 1,400 pound cheese to President Andrew Jackson who served it at a public White House reception attended by 10,000 people. Jackson&rsquo;s gesture inspired television show West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin to conceive a series of episodes in which the show&rsquo;s presidential administration holds recurring &ldquo;Big Block of Cheese Days&rdquo; that reimagine Jackson&rsquo;s reception for a twentieth-century audience. From 2014&ndash;2016 President Barack Obama's White House staff made #BigBlockofCheeseDay an annual virtual event in which &ldquo;members of the Obama administration&rdquo; took to social media to answer questions.

John Leland was born in 1754 and died in 1844. He was a Baptist preacher. In 1801 he took a preaching tour from his home in Massachusetts to Washington with his Cheshire cheese, and made his name national on account of that trip. He wrote his own hymns. He composed the hymn, \"The Day is Passed and Gone, The Evening Shades Appear.\" The farmers of Cheshire, for whom he was pastor, conceived the idea of sending the biggest cheese in America to President Jefferson. Mr. Leland offered to go to Washington with an ox team with it, and preach all along the way, which he did. The cheese weighed 1,450 pounds.

Leland&rsquo;s journey to Washington celebrated Jefferson&rsquo;s election with an outsize political message of its own. The &ldquo;mammoth cheese,&rdquo; made solely from the milk of cows owned by non-slaveholders (the milk of &ldquo;Federal[ist] cows&rdquo; was also excluded), was Leland&rsquo;s expression of support for Jefferson&rsquo;s advocacy of the separation of church and state and also monument to his own abolitionist leanings. When it arrived in Washington, the great cheese was enthusiastically welcomed by the president and prominently displayed at the White House for more than two years. Subsequent cheese makers followed in Leland&rsquo;s footsteps. Thomas Meacham of Sandy Creek, New York, delivered a 1,400 pound cheese to President Andrew Jackson who served it at a public White House reception attended by 10,000 people. Jackson&rsquo;s gesture inspired television show West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin to conceive a series of episodes in which the show&rsquo;s presidential administration holds recurring &ldquo;Big Block of Cheese Days&rdquo; that reimagine Jackson&rsquo;s reception for a twentieth-century audience. From 2014&ndash;2016 President Barack Obama's White House staff made #BigBlockofCheeseDay an annual virtual event in which &ldquo;members of the Obama administration&rdquo; took to social media to answer questions.
